# OpenIAP nodejs API

This is the client (and server) side api needed to connect and consume an OpenIAP flow instance, using one of the multiple protocols supported.

This version is for nodejs only, for browser implementation please see the [jsapi](https://github.com/openiap/jsapi) version

See [documentation](https://openiap.github.io/nodeapi/) for more information and examples

## installation
Install using npm with
```bash
npm install @openiap/nodeapi
```
For bleeding edge version directly from github, use
note: this require you also have git installed
```bash
npm install openiap/nodeapi
```

## Getting Started
We highly recomend you install the [vs code extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openiap.openiap-assistant) while working on your code. This can help you setup launch files with the correct envoriment variables and to publish your code to an OpenIAP flow instance.

```javascript
const { openiap } = require("@openiap/nodeapi");
client.connect().then(cli=> {
    console.log("Connected")
}

```
The npm package comes with type defenition for typescript as well, but for simplicity sake all examples are pure javascript. All functions rely on async/await patterns, so to login, add an entry to the entities collection, query it and close the connection again, we could
```javascript
const { openiap } = require("@openiap/nodeapi");
async function main() {
    const client = new openiap();
    await client.connect();
    const results = await client.Query( {
        query:  {"_type":"test"}, collectionname: "entities", projection: {"name": 1}
    })
    console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));
    client.Close();
}
main();
```

For code that will be running for a long time, like a webhook, or code waiting on message from a message queue, it's handy to do all initializaion in the onConnected callback. By default the client will auto connect to your OpenIAP flow instance if it looses connection, so by adding you initilizaion code here, it will get rerun when connected.

```javascript
async function onConnected(client) {
    const localqueue = await client.RegisterQueue({ queuename:""}, async (msg, payload, user, jwt)=> {
        if(payload == null) payload = {}
        payload.name = "A job well done."
        // Return updated payload to caller
        return payload;
    }
    console.log("listening on " + localqueue);
}
async function main() {
    const client = new openiap();
    client.onConnected = onConnected
    await client.connect();
}
main();
```

You **can** add the connection string to your OpenIAP flow instance using the client constructor.
```javascript
async function main() {
    const client = new openiap("grpc://grpc.app.openiap.io:443");
    await client.connect();
    client.Signin({username: "henrik", password: "SuperSecret"})
}
main();
```

You can also supply crendetials in the connection string, then you don't need to call Signin()
```javascript
async function main() {
    const client = new openiap("grpc://henrik:SuperSecret@grpc.app.openiap.io:443");
    client.onConnected = onConnected
    await client.connect();
}
main();
```

Please see [openiap constructor](https://openiap.github.io/nodeapi/classes/openiap.html#constructor) for more information about connecting strings


## api-documentation

All options are based of the proto3 files defined at the following [github repo](https://github.com/openiap/proto). More infromation about the underlayinng protocol are described there.

This repo can also be used as a server, but is not documented right now.

Using the openiap client offers access to the following functions
